* Appender
** Well, what is it?

A reddit bot, which appends videos to posts, written in Rust.

A good use-case would be the appending closing credit to the end of
the posted video.

** How do I build it?
You will need [[https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/getting-started/installation.html][cargo]].

#+BEGIN_SRC csh
% cargo build --release
#+END_SRC

Run-time dependencies are libsqlite & ffmpeg (binary).

** How do I use it?

Typically, just schedule the program launch via cron for, say, every 2
minutes and you are good to go.

** Supported video-hostings.

This version of bot supports these video-hosting platforms:

- Imgur
- Gfycat
- Reddit hosted-videos.

Converted videos are uploaded to Imgur.

** Configuration?

Appender is configurable via env-variables. All variables are
mandatory.
